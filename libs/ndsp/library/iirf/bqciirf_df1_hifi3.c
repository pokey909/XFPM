/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bi-quad Real Block IIR
  Computes a real IIR filter (cascaded IIR direct form I or II using 5 
  coefficients per bi-quad + gain term). Real input data are stored
  in vector x. The filter output result is stored in vector r. The filter 
  calculates N output samples using SOS and G matrices.
  NOTE:
  1. Bi-quad coefficients may be derived from standard SOS and G matrices 
  generated by MATLAB. However, typically biquad stages have big peaks 
  in their step response which may cause undesirable overflows at the 
  intermediate outputs. To avoid that the additional scale factors 
  coef_g[M] may be applied. These per-section scale factors may require 
  some tuning to find a compromise between quantization noise and possible 
  overflows. Output of the last section is directed to an additional 
  multiplier, with the gain factor being a power of two, either negative 
  or non-negative. It is specified through the total gain shift amount 
  parameter gain of each filter initialization function.
  2. 16x16 filters may suffer more from accumulation of the roundoff errors,
  so filters should be properly designed to match noise requirements

  Precision: 
  16x16         16-bit data, 16-bit coefficients, 16-bit intermediate stage outputs
  24x24         32-bit data, 24-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate stage outputs
  32x16         32-bit data, 16-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate stage outputs
  32x32         32-bit data, 32-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate stage outputs 
  f             floating point (DFI, DFII and DFIIt)

  Input:
  N             length of input sample block
  M             number of bi-quad sections
  s[]           scratch memory area (for fixed-point functions only). 
                Minimum number of bytes depends on selected filter structure 
                and precision:
                  BQRIIR16X16_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR16X16_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR24X24_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR24X24_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X16_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X16_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X32_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X32_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ).
                If a particular macro returns zero, then the corresponding
                IIR doesn't require a scratch area and parameter s may 
                hold zero.
  coef_sos[M*5] filter coefficients stored in blocks of 5 numbers: 
                b0 b1 b2 a1 a2. 
                For fixed-point funcions, fixed point format of filter 
                coefficients is Q1.14 for 16x16 and 32x16, or Q1.30 for 32x32 and 
                24x24 (in the latter case 8 LSBs are actually ignored). 
  coef_g[M]     scale factor for each section, Q15 (for fixed-point 
                functions only). Please note that 24x24 DFI implementation 
                internally truncates scale factors to Q7 values.
  gain          total gain shift amount applied to output signal of the
                last section, -48..15
  x[N]          input samples, Q15, Q31 or floating point 
  Output:
  r[N]          output data, Q15, Q31 or floating point 

  Restriction:
  x,r,s,coef_g,coef_sos should not overlap
  N   - must be a multiple of 2
  s[] - whenever supplied must be aligned on an 8-bytes boundary
